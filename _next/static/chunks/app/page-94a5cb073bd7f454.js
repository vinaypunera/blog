We wanted to pr","content":"<h2>Why This Matters</h2>\\n<p>Most technical blogs drown in maintenance. A CMS here, a plugin there, database queries that crawl under load, hosting bills that creep upward-the machinery meant to support writing becomes a burden instead. We wanted to prove something simpler: a blog can be fast, maintainable, and genuinely user-friendly without sacrificing essentials or chasing the latest frameworks.</p>\\n<p>This is how we built ours.</p>\\n<h2>The Architecture</h2>\\n<p>There\'s no mystery here. The stack is straightforward and each piece solves a real problem:</p>\\n<h3>Content Processing: Velite</h3>\\n<p><strong>Velite</strong> handles markdown at build time. Drop a <code>.md</code> file into <code>content/posts</code> with frontmatter (title, date, tags, optional cover image), and Velite validates the schema, calculates reading time, and passes typed content to the Next.js App Router. No manual entry. No API overhead. Files become data at build time-exactly when you need it.</p>\\n<h3>Hosting: Static Export</h3>\\n<p><strong>Next.js with <code>output: \\"export\\"</code></strong> pre-renders every page to pure HTML and CSS. No server, no database, no dynamic rendering. Everything is precomputed at build time and outputs as a static bundle ready for GitHub Pages, a CDN, or any static host. The result:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Pages load in milliseconds, even on slow networks.</li>\\n<li>Zero database attack surface.</li>\\n<li>Hosting costs pennies.</li>\\n<li>Uptime is boring-which is what you want.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>UI Foundation: Tailwind + shadcn/ui</h3>\\n<p>Clean, responsive layout without unnecessary weight. System fonts, a focused color palette, no custom imports or heavy libraries. Just accessible primitives and utility-first CSS that compounds into readable, maintainable pages.</p>\\n<h2>Reader Experience: Mobile-First</h2>\\n<p>We didn\'t optimize desktop first and shoehorn mobile in-we started with phones.</p>\\n<p>A <strong>floating navigation hub</strong> sits at the bottom-right, where thumbs naturally rest. It unfolds to reveal:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Search</strong>: a slide-down sheet that pulls from the top, ensuring the keyboard never covers the input. Filter by title, description, or tags. Active filters show inline; tap \\"Clear\\" and they reset.</li>\\n<li><strong>Share buttons</strong> that adapt: native share sheet on phones, direct LinkedIn/copy-to-clipboard on desktop.</li>\\n<li><strong>Theme toggle</strong> for dark/light mode, persisted via <code>next-themes</code>.</li>\\n<li><strong>Navigation</strong> to home or the author page without hunting for a sidebar.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>On desktop, hover over the button to unfurl the menu. Same interactions, adapted to input method. No mobile-only UI bloat.</p>\\n<p>Additional polish:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Reading progress bar</strong> fills as you scroll-visual feedback without getting in the way.</li>\\n<li><strong>Code syntax highlighting</strong> (Shiki) compiles to static HTML at build time. Zero runtime JavaScript.</li>\\n<li><strong>Post metadata</strong> (reading time, date, tags) auto-generates.</li>\\n<li><strong>Theme and search state persist</strong> across page reloads.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>The Win: Simplicity at Every Layer</h2>\\n<p><strong>For writers:</strong> Markdown files are the source of truth. Add a post, commit it, and the build handles the rest. No dashboard to learn. No CMS dialogs. No waiting for approval workflows. Write, save, done.</p>\\n<p><strong>For readers:</strong> Pages load fast. Responsive layout adapts from phones to desktops without awkward breakpoints. Theme preference persists. Search is instant. Navigation is always at thumb\'s reach. No clutter.</p>\\n<p><strong>For operators:</strong> Static files don\'t crash under traffic. No database to patch. Hosting is cheap. Uptime requires no monitoring. Deploy by pushing a folder to GitHub Pages or syncing to a CDN. That\'s it.</p>\\n<h2>Performance Without Compromise</h2>\\n<p>Static export + smart component choices = speed:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Sub-second page loads on any network.</li>\\n<li>No database queries hiding behind page renders.</li>\\n<li>CDN-friendly asset caching.</li>\\n<li>Framer Motion adds motion only where it clarifies interaction-never bloating the bundle.</li>\\n<li>Syntax highlighting compiles at build time, not runtime.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Next Steps</h2>\\n<p>This setup scales. Add related posts, RSS feeds, or analytics without disturbing the core. The goal isn\'t to be first with features-it\'s to be right with the fundamentals.</p>\\n<p>A technical blog doesn\'t need to be complex. It needs to be fast, maintainable, and pleasant to read. With modern tooling (Velite, Next.js static export, Tailwind), all three are within reach. The only variable is discipline: choose simplicity at each decision point, and everything else follows.</p>","slug":"building-stealthbit-blog","readingTime":{"text":"3 min read","minutes":3.13,"words":626}},{"title":"The P2P Paradox: Why You Need a Server to go Serverless","description":"Explore the peer-to-peer discovery problem.

It’s the magic behind instant, low-latency video calls in <strong>WebRTC</strong> and the decentralized promise of <strong>Web3</strong>. It\'s a world without middlemen, where your device talks directly to another.</p>\\n<p>Except for one massive, foundational problem.</p>\\n<p>How do you \\"directly\\" connect to a device that doesn\'t have a public address? If your laptop\'s IP is <code>192.168.1.100</code>, and your friend\'s is <code>10.0.0.50</code>, how do you find each other across the vast, public internet?</p>\\n<p>This is the P2P discovery problem. Before any \\"direct\\" connection can happen, you have to solve a complex puzzle of networking, security, and timing. This post explores that puzzle: the challenges of peer discovery and the ingenious solutions that make it work.</p>\\n<h3>The Great Wall: What is NAT?</h3>\\n<p>The root of our problem is <strong>Network Address Translation (NAT)</strong>. It’s the technology in your home router that lets your 15 different devices (laptop, phone, smart TV) all share a single public IP address provided by your ISP.</p>\\n<p>NAT was a brilliant solution to the problem of IPv4 address exhaustion, and it adds a layer of security by hiding your internal network from the outside world.</p>\\n<figure class=\\"mermaid-diagram\\"><img src=\\"/diagrams/p2p-paradox-diagram-1.svg\\" alt=\\"Diagram 1\\"></figure>\\n<p>But it also creates what I call the <strong>Three Layers of Ignorance</strong> for P2P:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>You don\'t know your own public address:</strong> Your laptop only knows its private IP (<code>192.168.1.100</code>). It has no idea what public IP the router is showing to the world.</li>\\n<li><strong>You don\'t know the peer\'s real address:</strong> Your peer has the same problem. They can\'t just tell you to connect to <code>192.168.1.50</code> because that address is private to <em>their</em> network.</li>\\n<li><strong>Routers block uninvited guests:</strong> Even if you <em>did</em> know your peer\'s public router IP, the router\'s firewall would drop your connection. It has no idea which of the 15 devices behind it should receive your packet, so it drops it for security.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>A NAT only allows <em>replies</em> to connections that were <em>started from inside</em> the network. This breaks the P2P model entirely, which relies on peers being able to contact each other.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<h3>The <em>Real</em> Challenge: Not All NATs Are Created Equal</h3>\\n<p>The problem gets worse. \\"NAT\\" isn\'t one single thing; it\'s a collection of behaviors. To build a system that works, you have to plan for the worst-case scenario.</p>\\n<h4>1. The \\"Friendly\\" Cone NATs</h4>\\n<p>Most NATs fall into this category (like Full Cone, Restricted Cone, or Port-Restricted Cone). Their behavior is <strong>predictable</strong>. When your device sends a packet out (e.g., to Server A), the NAT assigns it a public port, like <code>203.0.113.1:50000</code>.</p>\\n<p>The key is that it <strong>reuses that same public port</strong> (<code>:50000</code>) for other destinations (like Server B or Peer C). This predictability is a \\"hole\\" we can exploit.</p>\\n<figure class=\\"mermaid-diagram\\"><img src=\\"/diagrams/p2p-paradox-diagram-2.svg\\" alt=\\"Diagram 2\\"></figure>\\n<h4>2. The \\"Problem Child\\" Symmetric NAT</h4>\\n<p>This is the villain of our story. A <strong>Symmetric NAT</strong> is unpredictable and built for security. It doesn\'t just create one mapping; it creates a <strong>new, unique public port for every single destination</strong>.</p>\\n<p>Here’s why that breaks P2P:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Your app connects to a setup server (Server A) to find its public IP. Your NAT assigns you <code>203.0.113.1:50000</code>.</li>\\n<li>You tell your friend (Peer B), \\"Great! Connect to me at <code>203.0.113.1:50000</code>.\\"</li>\\n<li>Now, you try to send a packet to Peer B. Your Symmetric NAT sees this is a <em>new destination</em> and assigns you a <em>brand new port</em>: <code>203.0.113.1:50001</code>.</li>\\n<li>Your friend sends packets to <code>:50000</code> (which is now invalid or only for Server A), while you\'re sending from <code>:50001</code>.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Connection fails. You can\'t predict the port, and the port you discover isn\'t the one you\'ll use. This type is common in corporate networks and, critically, <strong>most 4G/5G mobile networks</strong>.</p>\\n<figure class=\\"mermaid-diagram\\"><img src=\\"/diagrams/p2p-paradox-diagram-3.svg\\" alt=\\"Diagram 3\\"></figure>\\n<hr>\\n<h3>The Solution: A Toolkit for Punching Holes</h3>\\n<p>Because of these challenges, we can\'t just \\"connect.\\" We need a coordinated strategy. This is where <strong>ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment)</strong> comes in-it\'s WebRTC\'s complete playbook for finding and connecting peers.</p>\\n<p>ICE uses a few key tools to solve the discovery problem.</p>\\n<h4>Step 1: The Signaling Server Paradox</h4>\\n<p>Here\'s the central irony of P2P: <strong>to establish a decentralized connection, you must first use a centralized server.</strong></p>\\n<p>This is the <strong>Signaling Server</strong>. It\'s the one piece of the puzzle that isn\'t P2P. Its job is <em>not</em> to relay your video or data (that\'s expensive). Its job is to be a matchmaker.</p>\\n<p>Peers A and B both connect to the signaling server. They use it to trade messages and coordinate the connection, saying things like:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\"Hi, I\'m Peer A, and I want to talk to Peer B.\\"</li>\\n<li>\\"Here are all the possible addresses I <em>think</em> I might be reachable at.\\"</li>\\n<li>\\"I\'m now trying to connect to you, get ready!\\"</li>\\n</ul>\\n<figure class=\\"mermaid-diagram\\"><img src=\\"/diagrams/p2p-paradox-diagram-4.svg\\" alt=\\"Diagram 4\\"></figure>\\n<h4>Step 2: Finding Your Address with STUN</h4>\\n<p>To solve the \\"I don\'t know my public IP\\" problem, we use <strong>STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT)</strong>.</p>\\n<p>A STUN server is a very simple tool. You send it a packet, and it replies with one piece of information: \\"Here is the public IP and port I saw your packet come from.\\"</p>\\n<p>This gives the peer its <strong>\\"server-reflexive\\" (srflx) address</strong>. The peer then passes this address to the other peer via the signaling server as a <em>candidate</em> address to try.</p>\\n<figure class=\\"mermaid-diagram\\"><img src=\\"/diagrams/p2p-paradox-diagram-5.svg\\" alt=\\"Diagram 5\\"></figure>\\n<h4>Step 3: The Clever Trick: UDP Hole Punching</h4>\\n<p>For the \\"friendly\\" Cone NATs, we can use a trick called <strong>UDP Hole Punching</strong>.</p>\\n<p>Now that both peers have (via the signaling server) a list of each other\'s <em>potential</em> public addresses (from STUN), they coordinate a \\"simultaneous send\\".</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Peer A sends a UDP packet to Peer B\'s STUN-discovered address.</li>\\n<li>At the exact same time, Peer B sends a UDP packet to Peer A\'s STUN-discovered address.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>From each NAT\'s perspective, this just looks like a normal <em>outbound</em> connection. This \\"punches a hole\\" in the NAT\'s state table, telling it, \\"I\'m expecting a reply from that IP and port.\\"</p>\\n<p>When Peer B\'s packet (which was sent <em>simultaneously</em>) arrives at Peer A\'s router, the router says, \\"Ah, this is the reply I was just told to expect!\\" and lets it through. A bidirectional connection is established.</p>\\n<figure class=\\"mermaid-diagram\\"><img src=\\"/diagrams/p2p-paradox-diagram-6.svg\\" alt=\\"Diagram 6\\"></figure>\\n<h4>Step 4: The Last Resort: TURN Relays</h4>\\n<p>But what about Symmetric NAT? Hole punching fails because the ports are unpredictable.</p>\\n<p>This is where we admit (partial) defeat and use <strong>TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT)</strong>. A TURN server is a powerful, and expensive, STUN server. Instead of just <em>telling</em> you your public IP, it acts as a full-blown mail-forwarding service.</p>\\n<p>You send your data to the TURN server, and the TURN server relays it to the other peer.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>The Good:</strong> It guarantees a connection will be established, even in the most restrictive mobile or corporate networks.</li>\\n<li><strong>The Bad:</strong> It\'s no longer true P2P. All your media flows through a central server, which adds <strong>latency</strong> and costs the service provider (e.g., Google, Twilio, or you) a <em>lot</em> of money in <strong>bandwidth</strong>.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Because 10-20% of users might be on a Symmetric NAT, services <em>must</em> pay for and provide TURN infrastructure for 100% of their users, just in case.</p>\\n<figure class=\\"mermaid-diagram\\"><img src=\\"/diagrams/p2p-paradox-diagram-7.svg\\" alt=\\"Diagram 7\\"></figure>\\n<h3>Why This Matters for WebRTC and Web3</h3>\\n<p>This entire stack - Signaling, STUN, Hole Punching, and TURN, is the magic that makes WebRTC work. It\'s a complex, orchestrated dance that tries the cheapest, fastest path (direct P2P) first and gracefully falls back to the most expensive, slowest path (TURN relay) only when necessary.</p>\\n<p>For Web3, the challenge is identical. A decentralized storage network (like IPFS) or a P2P social app still needs its nodes to find each other. They face the exact same NATs, and while they may try to avoid \\"centralized\\" signaling servers by using Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs), the fundamental problem of hole-punching and Symmetric NATs remains.</p>\\n<p>The next time you join a video call instantly, remember the incredible (and invisible) work happening in the background just to solve that first, hardest problem: \\"Hello? Are you out there?\\"</p>","slug":"p2p-paradox","readingTime":{"text":"8 min read","minutes":8.16,"words":1632}}]');var f=r(64269);g.filter(e=>!e.draft);let
